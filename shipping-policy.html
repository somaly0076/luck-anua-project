            <p> <b>SHIPPING DETAILS </b></p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> International orders are not accepted at the moment, as we only ship to the US. Also, non-contiguous US regions are  <br>
                    undeliverable.  </li>
                <li> We use UPS for the courier service and the delivery time varies by location.</li>
                <li> It usually takes about 6-7 business days on average, but duly note that there may be delays for unforeseen factors that occur during <br>
                    the shipment process.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p> <b>SHIPPING COST </b></p>
            <br>
            <p> 
                For US residents, a flat rate of $6.99 will be charged for shipping. However, please be noted that it may vary depending on the <br>
                region, such as Hawaii or Alaska.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Free shipping is offered for any orders above $60.</p>
            <br>
            <p> <b>RECIPIENT'S ABSENCE/UNCLEAR ADDRESS </b></p>
            <br>
            <p> Please provide a physical address, as UPS does not ship to PO Box, FPO/DPO/APO addresses.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                From time to time, a missed delivery or failed delivery attempt does happen due to your absence at the time of delivery or an <br>
                incomplete/unclear address.
                <br>
                In this case, the package will be returned to us, and you will receive a refund payment with the return fee deducted.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
